## 🎨 **Example Bot Responses:**

### **Before (Unstructured):**
```
User: "How do I connect Shopify?"

Bot: "You can connect Shopify by going to the Integrations 
page and clicking Connect. You'll need to enter your API 
credentials and then save them. Make sure you have the 
right permissions."
```

### **After (Production-Ready):**
```
User: "How do I connect Shopify?"

Bot: 
TL;DR: Go to Integrations, click Shopify Connect, 
enter credentials, save.

Steps:
1. Click 'Integrations' in the sidebar
2. Find the Shopify card, click 'Connect'
3. Enter your Shopify store URL (mystore.myshopify.com)
4. Enter API key and API secret
   (Get from: Shopify Admin > Apps > Develop apps)
5. Click 'Save' to start syncing

Explanation: The platform will automatically sync your 
orders, products, and inventory once connected. 
Initial sync takes 5-10 minutes.

⚠️ Security Note: Never share your full API credentials 
in this chat. Always enter them directly in the 
Integrations page.

### **Troubleshooting Example:**

```
User: "My dashboard isn't loading"

Bot:
TL;DR: Let's diagnose the dashboard issue with quick checks.

Step 1 - Gather Information:
- Can you see any error messages?
- When did this start?
- Does it show a blank page or loading forever?

Step 2 - Quick Fixes (try these):
1. Hard refresh: Press Ctrl + Shift + R
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try opening in incognito mode
4. Check another browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)

Step 3 - Check Integrations:
- Go to Integrations page
- Verify Shopify shows 'Connected' (green status)
- If not connected, your dashboard will be empty

Step 4 - Data Sync:
- If you just connected, wait 5-10 minutes for first sync
- Check "Last Synced" time in Integrations

Still not working? Send me:
1. The exact error (screenshot if possible)
2. Your browser name and version
3. Which steps you tried above

This will help me diagnose further!

### **Security Example:**

```
User: *pastes API key*

Bot:
⚠️ **SECURITY ALERT**

You just shared a secret API key in chat. This is not safe!

Immediate Action Required:
1. Go to your Shopify Admin
2. Navigate to Apps > API credentials
3. **Revoke this key immediately**
4. Generate a new key
5. Enter the NEW key in Integrations page (never in chat)

Why This Matters:
- Anyone with this key can access your store
- Keys shared in chat may be logged
- Always enter credentials directly in secure forms

🔒 Security Best Practice:
Never share passwords, API keys, or credentials in chat. 
Always use the platform's secure forms in Settings or 
Integrations pages.

Have you revoked the old key?
