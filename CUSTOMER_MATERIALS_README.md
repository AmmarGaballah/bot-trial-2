## 📞 Sales Talking Points

→ "You can always add overages at just $5 per 1,000 messages. Or upgrade anytime - no contracts!"

**"Not sure which plan"**
→ "No worries! Start with our FREE plan. You can upgrade as you grow. Most customers start with Starter ($29) and upgrade to Professional within 3 months."

**"Want to try first"**
→ "Perfect! We offer a 14-day free trial on all paid plans. No credit card needed. Plus, 30-day money-back guarantee."
